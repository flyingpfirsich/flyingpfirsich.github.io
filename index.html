    <p>Welcome to my personal website. I'm a student based in Berlin. <br>
    This is my <a href="./assets/CV.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
    <p>I was inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zswyWBtF-7Y">YouTube video</a> talking about the personal web. <br>
        The message about escaping the time sucking algorithm of big corporate social media really resonated with me. <br>
        I want to use the web as it was intended: to express myself through creating and forming real connections. <br>
        This website is my attempt to scream in to the infinite void of the internet in the hopes of connecting to a real human <br>
        being on the other side of the line. </p>
